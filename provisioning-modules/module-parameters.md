## Config Options <a id="config-options"></a>

[Config Options][product-config-options] (do not confuse with Configurable Options) are the module's settings.
These are defined in the ConfigOptions function of the module.
Config Options are set on a per product basis.
Supplied as a numbered list: $params\[‘configoption1’], $params\[‘configoption2’], etc.
Defined by the order specified in the ConfigOptions function of the module.

**Note:** Every module function except the \_ConfigOptions function receives the $params array. The \_ConfigOptions function is unique because it is the only function that is not called in relation to a specific client instance of a product or service.

## Custom Fields & Configurable Options <a id="custom-fields-configurable-options"></a>

Values from any custom fields & configurable options are passed into modules as parameters.
Passed as an array with the key being the name of the field or option.

For example for a custom field called “Username”, would become $params\[‘customfields’]\[‘Username’].
Likewise, a configurable option named “Disk Space”, would become $params\[‘configoptions’]\[‘Disk Space’].
