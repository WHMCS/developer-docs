If there is a blank page or error within the **Setup** > **Payment Gateways** page after uploading the new module file, then there is a syntax error within the new code.
To debug the new file, turn on error reporting.
Enable this in **Setup** > **General Settings** > **Other**.
This enables PHP error reporting and should show the cause of any issues.
Once resolved, disable Error Reporting again.
