The default system themes and order form templates are [available as read-only repositories on GitHub](https://github.com/WHMCS/).

For example, you may wish to fork these system themes and order form templates:

## System Templates

WHMCS ships with two Client Area themes:

* [Twenty-One](https://github.com/WHMCS/templates-twenty-one) (WHMCS 8.1 and later)
* [Six](https://github.com/WHMCS/templates-six)

We recommend using **Twenty-One** for new development.

## Order Form Templates

[Standard Cart](https://github.com/WHMCS/orderforms-standard_cart) is the default shopping cart template in WHMCS.
