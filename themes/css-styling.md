## Custom CSS

If you want to make changes to any of the CSS that is applied by default, we recommend making those customisations inside of the `/css/custom.css` file. This file is included after `styles.css`, allowing you to override any of the CSS defined within it. It will not be affected by future updates to the WHMCS software.

{{% notice tip %}}
* We strongly recommend adding your custom CSS rules to the `custom.css` file and **not** editing `/css/styles.css` directly because it will make updating easier.
* You may also wish to consider creating a [child theme](/themes/child-themes/).

## Using Font Awesome

To use Font Awesome icons, you may include the latest Font Awesome release shipped with WHMCS by including the line below within the `<head>` section of your template:

`<link href="{$WEB_ROOT}/assets/css/fontawesome-all.min.css" rel="stylesheet">`

Themes that do not include the above line will have it injected automatically. If you wish to prevent this behaviour, include the following line:

`<!-- /css/fontawesome-all.min.css -->`
