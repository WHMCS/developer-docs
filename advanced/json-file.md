When developing modules for WHMCS, you can place a `whmcs.json` file in the module's root directory to provide additional meta information that WHMCS will use in display of the **Apps & Integrations** pages. 

A sample `whmcs.json` is provided below:

```
{
  "schema": "1.0",
  "type": "whmcs-notifications",
  "name": "email",
  "license": "proprietary",
  "category": "notifications",
  "description": {
    "name": "Email",
    "tagline": "Configure rule based notifications delivered by email.",
    "long": "Setup advanced rule based notifications for events and triggers that matter to you and receive those notifications to one or more email addresses.",
    "features": [
      "Setup rule based events and triggers",
      "Receive notifications by email"
    ]
  },
  "logo": {
    "filename": "logo.png"
  },
  "support": {
    "homepage": "https:\/\/www.whmcs.com\/", 
    "learn_more": "https:\/\/www.whmcs.com\/tour", 
    "email": "support@whmcs.com", 
    "support_url": "https:\/\/support.whmcs.com\/",
    "docs_url": "https:\/\/docs.whmcs.com\/Notifications"
  },
  "authors": [
    {
      "name": "WHMCS",
      "homepage": "https:\/\/www.whmcs.com\/"
    }
  ]
}
```
